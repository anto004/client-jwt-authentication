# client-jwt-authentication

Client side project which I use to sign up new users or sign in current users. The [server](https://github.com/anto004/server-jwt-authentication) will register new users and authenticate current users.

### Start Project

- Run

  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

  or open with chrome browser

  ```

  npm start chrome

  ```


> Note:
> Make sure the server is already running
